### Task 1: Create a Basic Class

#### Objective

Write a Dart class named Book that holds information about books. Each book should have a title, author, and number of pages. Include a method to display this information.

### Task 2: Implement Inheritance

#### Objective

Create a class Novel that extends the Book class from Task 1. Add a specific property for the genre of the novel and override the displayInfo method to include the genre.

### Task 3: Demonstrate Polymorphism

#### Objective

Create an abstract class Shape with a method area(). Then, define two subclasses Circle and Rectangle that implement the area method. Demonstrate polymorphism by using a function that accepts a Shape and outputs its area.

### Task 4: Implement an Interface with Multiple Classes

#### Objective

Define an interface Serializable with a method toJson(). Then, implement this interface in classes User and Product which convert their properties to a JSON-like string.

### Task 5: Exception Handling in Class Methods

#### Objective

Create a class BankAccount with methods to deposit and withdraw money. Implement custom exception handling to prevent the account from being overdrawn
